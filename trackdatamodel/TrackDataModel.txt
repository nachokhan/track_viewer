The Track Data Model contains the classes needed to define a Track 
with its segments, its points, and whatever we may need now and in 
the future.

It is a module with almost no calculations, and it contains only 
real data.

But what does "real data" means? Well, when we mess elevation with
a GPS device, we obtain a number. The same happens with the latitude, 
longitude, time, or even with the effort (if we have a special device 
that allow us to do it). We could even calculate the disnatce between
two points and it will be still "real data" because its already 
stablished how we can do it and we hace no inference on it.

So this is "real" data in the sense that we are not allowed to say 
"this is right" or "this is wrong". It just data that came to us 
from the outside. Note: when I say "us" I mean of course that "we" 
are this software. Have you ever wonder to be a software? Here is 
your opportunity ;)

Other type of values (or "data") like difficulty (that WE assign) would 
not be considered in this module. Because it is like "pollution" in the 
"fresh" model with data we dont't know if it is ok or not. This is the 
"I'm wrong, they're right" principle. I will consider that every 
information that comes to me from the outside world (or or every 
information that I can calculate with methods that come to me also from 
the outside world) is right. Why would I do this? Because it is not my 
fault who and how was it made. All I can do is take it, but no modify it. 
If I modify, e.g. the way distance between two GPS points are normally 
calculated, I may be adding an error because of my brain's potential 
defects. But if I use an standard method, then it is not my fault I it 
was wrong. The correction comes from the outside and all I have to do 
is replace it with the corrected version.
