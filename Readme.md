GPXFileReader
-------------

The code defines a class `GPXFileReader` and two helper functions for reading and parsing GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files.

Here's an overview of each component:

### Class: `GPXFileReader`

- `__init__(self, filename)`: Initializes the object with a filename.
- `set_file_name(self, filename)`: Sets a new filename. Note that there is a typo; the attribute should be `self.__file` instead of `self.__filen`.
- `read(self)`: Reads the GPX file and returns a `Track` object containing track information such as name, author, and GPS points within a `Segment`.
- `get_XML_nodes(self, xml, lista, i=0)`: Given an XML object, this function traverses it based on the comma-separated string list (`lista`) and returns the XML nodes at the last hierarchy level specified by the list.
- `get_XML_node_text(self, xml, lista, i=0)`: Similar to `get_XML_nodes`, this function traverses the XML object to get the text content of the XML node specified by the list `lista`.

The class and functions work together as follows:

1. `GPXFileReader.read()` opens the GPX file and reads its content using BeautifulSoup, a library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
2. It extracts the track name, author name, and track points from the GPX file.
3. A new `Track` object is created, and its name and author are set.
4. A `Segment` object is created and populated with `GPSPoint` objects based on the latitude, longitude, and elevation found in the GPX file.
5. Finally, this `Segment` is added to the `Track`, and the populated `Track` object is returned.

The code relies on having a `Track` class that can contain `Segment` objects, and each `Segment` object can hold `GPSPoint` objects, but these classes are not defined within this code snippet.

Note: The script uses the BeautifulSoup library for XML parsing, but the library itself is not imported in the code snippet. Also, the class and functions assume that the GPX file has a specific hierarchy of XML tags, as indicated in `GPX_STR_TRACK_NAME`, `GPX_STR_AUTHOR_NAME`, and `GPX_STR_TRACK_POINTS`.


GPSVisualizerFileReader
-----------------------

The code defines a class `GPSVisualizerFileReader` for reading and parsing text files that contain GPS points and segment information. This class creates objects of the type `DrawableSegment` and `Track` to store the GPS points and segments.

Here's a breakdown of each component:

### Class: `GPSVisualizerFileReader`

- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the object with an empty `DrawableSegment` and an empty `Track`.

- `read_file(self, fileName)`: Reads a text file line-by-line and calls `analyze_line()` on each line to populate the `Track` object. Returns the populated `Track`.

- `analyze_line(self, line)`: Takes a line from the text file and decides what to do based on the first element. If the first element is 'T', it calls `get_values_from_line()` to obtain a GPS point, name, and color, which are then added to the current `DrawableSegment`. If the first element is 'type', it creates a new `DrawableSegment` and adds it to the `Track`.

- `get_values_from_line(self, line)`: Splits a line by commas and returns a tuple containing a `GPSPoint`, a name, and a color.

- `get_track(self)`: Returns the populated `Track`.

The class assumes that the text file contains lines starting with 'T' or 'type', where 'T' indicates a GPS point and 'type' indicates the start of a new segment.

- Lines starting with 'T' should have this structure: "T,lat,lon,elev,name,color".
- Lines starting with 'type' indicate a new segment.

The `DrawableSegment` and `Track` classes and their methods (`add_point`, `set_color`, `set_name`, `add_segment`) are not defined in this code snippet, but the script assumes their existence and specific functionalities.

Note: The class uses a method `readlines()` to read the file, which reads the entire file into memory. This could be an issue for very large files.




TrackAnalyzer
-------------

The code defines a module called "Analyzer" for analyzing tracks that consist of GPS segments and points. The tracks can come from different formats like GPX, TCX, or KML.

Here's a brief rundown of each function:

sign(x): Returns the sign of a number x. Zero is considered negative to detect up and downhills.

segment_from_change_position(segment, segmentations): Segments a given track segment based on change positions, and returns a list of new segments.

extract_segment_1(track, method=0): Extracts new segments from a track based on multiple criteria like slope changes and height differences. It returns a new track made up of these new segments.

normalize_elevation(segment): Returns a new segment with normalized elevation data using a moving average filter.

remove_short_distances(segment, min_distance=4): Removes points from a segment that are too close to each other based on a specified minimum distance.

segment_by_height(segment, segmentations): Returns a list of new segmentation positions based on elevation changes.

get_slope_sign_change_position(segment): Returns a list of positions where the slope changes direction.

graficar_dos_x(s1, s2): Plots the elevation data for two segments using matplotlib.

The code assumes that you have classes Track, Segment, and GPSPoint defined in another module (track_model). The Track class is expected to contain a list of Segment objects, and each Segment object contains a list of GPSPoint objects.

The script primarily aims to analyze GPS tracks, divide them into segments based on different characteristics like slope or elevation, and possibly plot them for visual inspection.
